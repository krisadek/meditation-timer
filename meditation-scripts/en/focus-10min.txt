FOCUS MEDITATION - 10 MINUTES
Evidence-Based Techniques: Breath Awareness + Attention Training + Mindful Observation

[0:00] Welcome to this focus meditation. Find a comfortable, alert seated position with your spine upright but not rigid.

[0:20] Close your eyes or soften your gaze, looking down at a point in front of you.

[0:35] Take a deep breath in through your nose... and exhale fully through your mouth.

[0:50] Again, breathe in deeply... and release completely.

[1:00] One more time... breathe in... and let it go.

[1:15] Now allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm. You're not controlling it, simply observing.

[1:30] Bring your attention to the sensation of breathing at the tip of your nose. Notice the cool air as you breathe in... the warm air as you breathe out.

[1:55] Cool in... warm out. Just this simple observation.

[PAUSE 15 seconds]

[2:20] Your mind will wander. This is normal. This is what minds do. When you notice your attention has drifted, gently bring it back to the breath at your nose.

[2:45] Each time you notice your mind has wandered and you bring it back, you're strengthening your focus muscle. This is the practice.

[3:10] Cool air in... warm air out... noticing at the tip of your nose.

[PAUSE 20 seconds]

[3:40] Now expand your awareness to include the full journey of each breath. Notice the breath entering your nostrils...

[3:55] ...traveling down through your throat and chest...

[4:05] ...filling your lungs and belly...

[4:15] ...and then the reverse journey as you exhale... belly... lungs... chest... throat... nose.

[4:35] Follow each complete breath with your full attention. Beginning... middle... end.

[PAUSE 30 seconds]

[5:15] When thoughts arise, which they will, simply note "thinking" and return to the breath. No judgment, just gentle redirection.

[5:35] You might notice sounds around you. Note "hearing" and return to the breath.

[5:50] Physical sensations might call for attention. Note "feeling" and return to the breath.

[6:05] The anchor is always here: the breath, happening now, in this moment.

[PAUSE 40 seconds]

[6:55] Notice the quality of your attention now. Is it sharper? More focused? Simply observe without judgment.

[7:15] Continue to follow each breath with full awareness. Present with each inhale... present with each exhale.

[PAUSE 45 seconds]

[8:10] Thoughts are like clouds passing through the sky of your mind. You don't need to push them away or hold onto them. Just let them pass and return to the breath.

[8:35] Anchored in the breath... focused in the present moment... alert and aware.

[PAUSE 30 seconds]

[9:15] Take a slightly deeper breath in... and exhale slowly.

[9:25] Notice how your mind feels now. More clear? More settled? This clarity is available to you anytime you pause and focus on your breath.

[9:45] Take one more deep breath... and gently open your eyes.

[9:55] Carry this focused, clear attention with you as you move forward with your day.

[10:00] END
