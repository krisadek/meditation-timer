FOCUS MEDITATION - 15 MINUTES
Evidence-Based Techniques: Attention Training + Breath Counting + Present Moment Awareness

[0:00] Welcome to this 15-minute focus meditation. Sit in a comfortable, upright position that communicates wakefulness and alertness.

[0:20] Plant your feet firmly on the floor. Feel your sitting bones connecting with your seat.

[0:35] Roll your shoulders up, back, and down. Let your spine be long and natural.

[0:50] Rest your hands comfortably on your thighs or in your lap.

[1:00] Close your eyes or lower your gaze to a point on the floor about three feet in front of you.

[1:15] Take a full, deep breath in... and exhale with a sigh, releasing any tension.

[1:30] Again, breathe in deeply... and let it go.

[1:40] One more time... inhale... and release.

[2:00] Allow your breath to settle into its natural rhythm. Easy, effortless breathing.

[2:15] We'll use a counting technique to anchor and sharpen our attention. This prevents mind-wandering and builds concentration.

[2:35] Bring your attention to your breath. At the end of each exhale, silently count. Inhale... exhale... "one." Inhale... exhale... "two."

[3:00] Continue this way up to ten, then begin again at one. Just breathing and counting.

[3:15] Inhale... exhale... one.
Inhale... exhale... two.
Inhale... exhale... three.
Inhale... exhale... four.
Inhale... exhale... five.

[4:00] If you lose count or notice you've gone past ten, simply start again at one. No problem. This is part of the practice.

[4:20] Continue counting your breaths. Each number marking a moment of focused attention.

[PAUSE 60 seconds]

[5:30] Notice when your mind wanders to thoughts of the past or future. Without judgment, acknowledge the distraction and return to counting. One... two... three...

[6:00] Each time you return your attention, you're strengthening your capacity for focus. This is how the mind is trained.

[6:25] Continue with your counting practice. Present with each breath.

[PAUSE 90 seconds]

[8:05] Now we'll shift from counting to simply observing. Let go of the numbers.

[8:20] Rest your attention on the natural flow of your breathing. Notice where you feel it most clearly: at your nose, your chest, or your belly.

[8:40] Anchor your attention there. Feel each breath arrive... notice the brief pause at the top... feel the breath release... notice the space before the next breath begins.

[9:10] Your breath is your home base. Whenever your attention wanders, come home to the breath.

[PAUSE 30 seconds]

[9:50] Notice sounds arising and passing. You don't need to push them away. Let them be part of the background while your breath remains in the foreground of your attention.

[10:15] Notice physical sensations. Perhaps tingling, warmth, coolness, pressure. Acknowledge them and return to the breath.

[10:35] Notice thoughts. They'll come like uninvited guests. You don't need to engage with them. Simply notice and return to the breath.

[11:00] The breath is always happening now. It pulls you out of the past and future and into this present moment.

[PAUSE 45 seconds]

[12:00] This quality of attention you're cultivating is like a muscle. The more you practice, the stronger it becomes.

[12:20] You're training your mind to be less reactive, more focused, clearer.

[12:40] Continue to rest in breath awareness. Alert, awake, present.

[PAUSE 60 seconds]

[13:50] Begin to expand your awareness beyond the breath to include your whole body sitting here.

[14:05] Notice your posture. Feel the weight of your body. Sense the space around you.

[14:20] Take a deep, energizing breath in... and exhale fully.

[14:30] Another deep breath... and release.

[14:40] Begin to wiggle your fingers and toes gently.

[14:48] Roll your shoulders. Stretch your neck side to side.

[14:55] When you're ready, open your eyes. Bring this focused, clear awareness into whatever you do next.

[15:00] END
