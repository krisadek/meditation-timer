RELAXATION MEDITATION - 10 MINUTES
Evidence-Based Techniques: Progressive Muscle Relaxation + Body Scan + Cyclic Sighing

[0:00] Welcome to this 10-minute relaxation meditation.

Find a comfortable position where you can remain undisturbed. Allow your eyes to close gently.

[0:20] We'll begin with a breathing technique scientifically shown to reduce stress and promote deep relaxation.

Take a deep breath in through your nose... and exhale slowly through your mouth with a soft sigh... releasing tension.

[0:40] Again, breathe in deeply... and exhale with a gentle sigh, letting go of the day's stress.

One more time... breathe in... and sigh it out.

[1:00] Now settle into your natural breathing rhythm. Notice the gentle rise and fall of your belly.

[1:15] We'll now move through your body, briefly tensing and then releasing each muscle group to promote deep relaxation.

[1:30] Bring attention to your feet. Gently curl your toes and tense the muscles... hold for a moment... and release completely. Feel the difference between tension and relaxation.

[1:50] Tense your calf muscles... hold... and let go. Feel them soften and relax.

[2:05] Tighten your thigh muscles... hold... and release. Notice the wave of relaxation flowing through your legs.

[2:25] Gently tense your buttocks and hips... and release. Let your lower body sink into complete relaxation.

[2:45] Take a deep breath and hold it, tensing your belly... and exhale fully, releasing all tension from your core.

[3:05] Squeeze your hands into gentle fists... hold... and open them, letting your hands rest softly.

[3:20] Tense your arms... hold... and release. Feel your arms becoming heavy and relaxed.

[3:40] Lift your shoulders toward your ears... hold... and drop them down. Feel the tension melting away from your shoulders and neck.

[4:00] Gently squeeze your facial muscles toward the center of your face... and release. Let your face become soft and peaceful.

[4:20] Now your entire body is deeply relaxed. Simply rest here, breathing naturally.

[PAUSE 20 seconds]

[4:50] Bring your attention to the top of your head. Sense a warm, gentle wave of relaxation beginning here.

[5:05] Feel this wave slowly moving down through your forehead... your eyes... your cheeks... washing away any remaining tension.

[5:25] The wave flows down through your neck and shoulders... feel them soften even more.

[5:40] It moves through your chest and upper back... notice your breath flowing easily and naturally.

[6:00] The wave continues down through your belly... your lower back... feel yourself sinking deeper into relaxation.

[6:20] It flows down through your hips... your thighs... your knees... bringing profound relaxation.

[6:40] Down through your calves... ankles... and feet... all the way to the tips of your toes.

[7:00] Your entire body is now in a state of deep, peaceful relaxation.

[PAUSE 30 seconds]

[7:40] Rest in this peaceful state. If your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to the feeling of relaxation in your body.

[PAUSE 40 seconds]

[8:30] Begin to deepen your breath slightly. Notice how calm and relaxed you feel.

[8:45] Silently acknowledge: "I am deeply relaxed. I am at peace. I carry this calm with me."

[9:05] Start to bring gentle awareness back to your surroundings. Notice any sounds around you.

[9:20] Wiggle your fingers and toes slowly. Take your time.

[9:30] Roll your shoulders gently. Stretch if it feels good.

[9:40] When you're ready, slowly open your eyes, bringing this deep relaxation with you into your day.

[9:55] Thank you for dedicating this time to your wellbeing.

[10:00] END
