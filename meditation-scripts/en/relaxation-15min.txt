RELAXATION MEDITATION - 15 MINUTES
Evidence-Based Techniques: Full Body Scan + Diaphragmatic Breathing + Guided Imagery

[0:00] Welcome to this 15-minute relaxation meditation.

Find a comfortable position, lying down or sitting with your back supported. Close your eyes gently.

[0:20] Begin by placing one hand on your chest and one on your belly. As you breathe in, feel your belly rise like a balloon filling with air.

[0:40] Breathe in through your nose, feeling your belly expand... and exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your belly fall.

[1:00] Continue this diaphragmatic breathing. In through the nose, belly rises... out through the mouth, belly falls.

[1:20] Notice how this deep belly breathing naturally calms your nervous system.

[PAUSE 20 seconds]

[1:50] Now you can relax your hands to your sides and allow your breath to find its own natural, comfortable rhythm.

[2:10] Bring your attention to your feet. Notice any sensations... temperature... tingling... pressure... or perhaps no sensation at all. Simply observe with curiosity.

[2:35] Notice your ankles... your shins... your calves. If there's any tension, imagine it dissolving with each exhale.

[3:00] Bring awareness to your knees... your thighs. Feel the weight of your legs. Notice them becoming heavier, more relaxed.

[3:25] Notice your hips and pelvis. Release any gripping or holding. Let this area soften completely.

[3:50] Bring attention to your lower belly. With each breath, feel this area gently expanding and releasing. Let go of any tension stored here.

[4:15] Notice your middle and upper back. Feel the surface supporting you. Allow your back muscles to soften and spread.

[4:40] Bring awareness to your chest. Feel your heart beating steadily. Notice the gentle rise and fall of each breath. Trust your body's natural wisdom.

[5:10] Notice your shoulders. Often we hold stress here. With your next exhale, let your shoulders drop and soften even more.

[5:35] Bring attention to your arms... your elbows... your forearms. Feel them becoming heavy and relaxed.

[6:00] Notice your wrists... your hands... each finger. Let your hands rest softly, fingers gently curled.

[6:25] Bring awareness to your neck, feeling it long and relaxed. Notice your throat, soft and open.

[6:50] Observe your jaw. Let it hang loose, teeth slightly apart. Release any clenching.

[7:10] Notice your lips, soft and relaxed. Your cheeks, heavy and peaceful.

[7:25] Feel your eyes resting gently in their sockets, no effort needed to keep them closed.

[7:40] Notice your forehead, smooth and wide. Your scalp, relaxed.

[8:00] Bring attention to the crown of your head. Your entire body is now deeply scanned and relaxed.

[PAUSE 20 seconds]

[8:30] Now imagine yourself in a peaceful place in nature. Perhaps a quiet beach, a serene forest, or a calm meadow.

[8:50] See the colors around you... the soft light... notice the details of this peaceful place.

[9:10] Hear the gentle sounds... perhaps waves, birdsong, or rustling leaves. Let these sounds deepen your relaxation.

[9:30] Feel the air on your skin... the comfortable temperature... the gentle breeze.

[9:50] Smell the fresh, clean scent of nature around you.

[10:05] Feel yourself completely safe, completely at peace in this beautiful place.

[PAUSE 30 seconds]

[10:45] Rest here in this profound state of relaxation. There's nowhere to go, nothing to do. Simply be.

[PAUSE 60 seconds]

[12:00] Your body knows how to relax. Your mind knows how to be peaceful. Trust this natural capacity within you.

[PAUSE 30 seconds]

[12:40] Begin to bring your awareness back to your physical body, still feeling deeply relaxed.

[12:55] Notice your breath, flowing naturally and easily.

[13:10] Start to deepen your breath slightly. Breathe in calm... breathe out peace.

[13:30] Bring gentle movement to your fingers and toes. Take your time.

[13:45] Wiggle your hands and feet gently.

[13:55] Roll your ankles... roll your wrists.

[14:05] Stretch your arms above your head if that feels good.

[14:15] Roll gently to one side, taking a moment there.

[14:25] When you're ready, slowly press yourself up to sitting.

[14:35] Open your eyes softly, adjusting to the light.

[14:45] Notice how calm and relaxed you feel. Take this peaceful state with you.

[14:55] Thank you for practicing relaxation with me today.
