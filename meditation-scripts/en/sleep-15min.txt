SLEEP MEDITATION - 15 MINUTES
Evidence-Based Techniques: Diaphragmatic Breathing + Progressive Relaxation + Sleep Imagery

[0:00] Welcome to this sleep meditation. Lie down in bed, making yourself completely comfortable.

[0:20] Close your eyes and take a moment to notice how your body feels against the bed.

[0:35] Place one hand on your belly. As you breathe in, feel your belly rise. As you breathe out, feel it fall.

[0:55] Breathe in deeply through your nose, belly expanding... and exhale fully through your mouth, belly falling.

[1:15] Again, deep breath in, belly rises... and long breath out, belly falls.

[1:35] One more time... breathe in deeply... and release completely.

[1:50] Now allow your hand to rest comfortably at your side, and let your breath find its own natural, easy rhythm.

[2:10] There's nowhere to go... nothing to do... just rest.

[PAUSE 15 seconds]

[2:35] Bring your attention to your feet and toes. Wiggle them gently one last time... and then let them be completely still. Feel them becoming heavy and relaxed.

[3:00] Notice your ankles, your calves, your shins. Any tension held here can now drain away, like water flowing down and out.

[3:25] Your knees soften... your thighs become heavy... sinking down into the bed beneath you.

[3:50] Feel your hips and buttocks releasing... letting go... melting into the mattress.

[4:15] Your lower back eases... your belly softens with each gentle breath... there's no need to hold or control anything.

[4:45] Your middle and upper back spread wide across the bed... supported... held.

[5:10] Your chest rises and falls in a slow, natural rhythm... peaceful... calm.

[5:35] Your shoulders... often tight from the day... now drop down heavily... releasing toward the bed... so much space opening up in your neck and shoulders.

[6:05] Your arms are heavy by your sides... your elbows soft... your forearms relaxed.

[6:25] Your wrists... your hands... each finger... all heavy and still. Nothing to grasp, nothing to hold.

[6:50] Your neck is long and free... your head heavy on the pillow... completely supported.

[7:15] Your jaw unlocks and hangs loose... teeth slightly apart... tongue resting softly in your mouth.

[7:35] Your lips are barely touching... your cheeks feel heavy... peaceful.

[7:50] Your eyes are closed, still, and heavy... no effort needed... just resting deeply.

[8:05] Your forehead is smooth and wide... your temples soft... your scalp relaxed.

[8:25] Your whole body is now deeply, completely relaxed. Heavy. Still. At peace.

[PAUSE 20 seconds]

[8:55] Now imagine the sun is setting... the sky grows dim... soft colors of dusk spread across the horizon.

[9:20] The world around you grows quiet... peaceful... preparing for rest, just as you are.

[9:45] Darkness gently falls like a soft blanket... comforting... safe... warm.

[10:05] Stars begin to appear, one by one, in the deep night sky.

[10:25] The moon rises, casting a gentle, silvery light... soothing... calming.

[10:45] Everything in nature is settling into rest... birds are quiet in their nests... animals curl up in their dens... trees stand still in the night.

[11:15] You too are part of this natural rhythm of rest... your body knows how to sleep... trusts this process.

[11:40] Feel yourself sinking deeper... and deeper... into the soft, warm darkness of sleep.

[12:05] With each breath, you let go more... drifting... floating... releasing.

[PAUSE 20 seconds]

[12:35] Your mind grows quieter... thoughts slow down... becoming distant and dreamlike.

[13:00] You are safe... you are comfortable... you can completely let go now.

[13:25] Drift... deeper... and deeper... into peaceful sleep.

[PAUSE 30 seconds]

[14:05] Let sleep come naturally... easily... welcoming rest.

[14:30] Breathing softly... sinking down... sleeping deeply.

[PAUSE 20 seconds]

[15:00] [END - silence allows natural transition to sleep]
