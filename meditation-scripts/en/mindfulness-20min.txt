MINDFULNESS MEDITATION - 20 MINUTES
Evidence-Based Techniques: Full Body Awareness + Thought Observation + Choiceless Awareness

[0:00] Welcome to this 20-minute mindfulness meditation. Sit comfortably with an alert, upright posture.

[0:20] Rest your hands gently. Allow your eyes to close.

[0:35] Take a full, deep breath in... and exhale completely.

[0:50] Again, breathe in deeply... and release with a sigh.

[1:05] One more cleansing breath... and let it go.

[1:20] Allow your breath to settle into its own natural rhythm.

[1:40] Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present with your experience, exactly as it is, without judgment.

[2:00] Begin by bringing gentle attention to the physical sensation of breathing. Notice where you feel the breath most clearly.

[2:25] Perhaps at your nostrils, feeling the air moving in and out.

[2:40] Perhaps in your chest, feeling it rise and fall.

[2:55] Perhaps in your belly, feeling it expand and contract.

[3:10] Choose one location and rest your attention there. Simply observing each breath.

[PAUSE 30 seconds]

[3:50] Breathing in, you know you're breathing in. Breathing out, you know you're breathing out.

[4:10] This simple awareness is the foundation of mindfulness.

[PAUSE 45 seconds]

[5:05] Now we'll expand awareness to include the whole body. Feel your body sitting here as one complete experience.

[5:30] Notice the contact points: your feet on the floor, your seat on the chair, your hands resting.

[5:55] Feel the weight of your body being pulled by gravity.

[6:15] Sense your body from the inside: a field of sensation, constantly changing.

[6:35] Perhaps there's tension somewhere. You don't need to fix it. Just notice it with kind awareness.

[6:55] Perhaps there's ease somewhere. Notice that too.

[7:15] Your body is breathing you. Your heart is beating. All this is happening without your effort or control. Simply witness it.

[PAUSE 40 seconds]

[8:05] Expand your awareness to include sounds. Let sounds come to you. You don't need to search for them.

[8:25] Notice sounds near and far. Pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. Without preference, just hearing.

[8:50] Sounds arise, exist briefly, and fade away. This is the nature of all experience.

[PAUSE 30 seconds]

[9:30] Now bring attention to thoughts. Usually we're lost in thought, identified with thinking.

[9:50] In mindfulness, we step back and observe thought as just another experience arising in awareness.

[10:10] See if you can watch thoughts appear... notice them... and watch them dissolve.

[10:30] Thoughts about the past... thoughts about the future... planning... remembering... judging... fantasizing.

[10:50] You don't need to engage with them. Simply note: "Thinking is happening."

[11:10] You are not your thoughts. You are the spacious awareness in which thoughts appear.

[PAUSE 45 seconds]

[12:05] When you notice you've been lost in thought, caught up in a story, simply acknowledge it with kindness.

[12:25] "Lost in thought." Then return to present moment awareness.

[12:40] This is the practice: noticing when attention has wandered, and gently coming back. Again and again, without judgment.

[PAUSE 60 seconds]

[13:50] Now practice what's called "choiceless awareness." Instead of focusing on one thing, open your awareness to whatever is most predominant.

[14:15] Perhaps it's a breath... a sound... a sensation... a thought... an emotion.

[14:35] Let your attention rest on whatever is strongest in your experience right now.

[14:55] When it fades, notice what arises next. Be present with that.

[15:15] Awareness flowing naturally from one experience to the next, not forcing, not controlling, just noticing.

[PAUSE 90 seconds]

[17:00] In this open awareness, notice the constant change. Sensations shift. Sounds come and go. Thoughts appear and disappear.

[17:25] Nothing stays the same. Everything is in flux. This is the nature of experience.

[17:50] And yet, awareness itself remains steady, like the sky that holds all changing weather.

[18:15] Rest as this awareness. Open, spacious, present.

[PAUSE 30 seconds]

[18:55] Begin to narrow your attention back to the breath.

[19:10] Feel your body breathing. Ground yourself in this present moment.

[19:25] Take a deep, conscious breath in... and exhale slowly.

[19:35] Notice how you feel. More present? More aware? More settled?

[19:48] This awareness is always available. You can return here anytime.

[19:58] Gently open your eyes, carrying this mindful presence with you.

[20:00] END
