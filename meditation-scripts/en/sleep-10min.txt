SLEEP MEDITATION - 10 MINUTES
Evidence-Based Techniques: 4-7-8 Breathing + Body Scan + Sleep Visualization

[0:00] Welcome to this sleep meditation. Get comfortable in bed, allowing your body to be fully supported.

[0:15] Close your eyes and take a moment to settle in.

[0:25] We'll begin with the 4-7-8 breathing technique, scientifically shown to promote sleep by activating your body's relaxation response.

[0:40] Breathe in quietly through your nose for a count of four: 1... 2... 3... 4...

[0:52] Hold your breath for a count of seven: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7...

[1:05] Exhale completely through your mouth for a count of eight: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8...

[1:25] Again, breathe in through your nose: 1... 2... 3... 4...

[1:35] Hold: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7...

[1:45] Exhale slowly: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8...

[2:00] One more time. Breathe in: 1... 2... 3... 4...

[2:10] Hold: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7...

[2:20] And release: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8...

[2:35] Now let your breath return to its natural rhythm. Notice how your body already feels more relaxed, more ready for sleep.

[3:00] Bring gentle awareness to your feet. They've carried you all day. Now they can completely rest. Feel them becoming heavy, sinking into the bed.

[3:25] Notice your legs becoming heavy... so heavy... releasing into the softness beneath you.

[3:45] Your hips and lower back soften... sinking down... melting into rest.

[4:05] Your belly rises and falls with each easy breath... so peaceful... so calm.

[4:25] Your chest feels open and relaxed... your breathing slow and natural.

[4:45] Your shoulders drop away from your ears... releasing the day's burdens... so heavy now... so relaxed.

[5:05] Your arms feel heavy by your sides... your hands soft and still... nothing to hold onto... nothing to do.

[5:30] Your neck is long and comfortable... your head heavy on the pillow.

[5:45] Your jaw hangs loose and soft... your tongue rests in your mouth... your lips are gently closed or slightly parted.

[6:05] Your eyes are closed and still... no need to open them... resting deeply in their sockets.

[6:20] Your forehead is smooth... your whole face peaceful and serene.

[6:35] Your entire body is heavy... sinking down into deep rest.

[PAUSE 15 seconds]

[7:00] Imagine a soft, warm blanket of sleepiness slowly covering you, starting at your feet.

[7:15] This gentle wave of drowsiness moves up through your legs... so soothing... so comfortable.

[7:35] It flows up through your torso... your chest... warmth and heaviness spreading.

[7:55] Up through your shoulders... down your arms... everything becoming deeply still.

[8:15] The wave reaches your neck... your face... the top of your head... completely covered in this peaceful blanket of sleep.

[8:40] You are safe... you are comfortable... you can let go now.

[9:00] With each breath, you drift deeper... and deeper... into peaceful, restful sleep.

[9:25] Let go... drift... sleep.

[PAUSE 30 seconds]

[10:00] [END - silence allows natural transition to sleep]
