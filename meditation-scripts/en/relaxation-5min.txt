RELAXATION MEDITATION - 5 MINUTES
Evidence-Based Techniques: Body Scan + Diaphragmatic Breathing

[0:00] Welcome to this 5-minute relaxation meditation.

Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Allow your eyes to gently close.

[0:15] Begin by taking a deep breath in through your nose, feeling your belly expand... and slowly release through your mouth.

[0:30] Take another deep breath in... feeling the cool air enter your nostrils... and exhale fully, releasing any tension.

One more deep breath... and let it go.

[0:50] Now allow your breathing to return to its natural rhythm. Notice the gentle rise and fall of your belly with each breath.

[1:10] Bring your attention to the top of your head. Notice any sensations there without trying to change anything. Simply observe.

[1:25] Let your awareness flow down to your face. Release any tension in your forehead... soften the muscles around your eyes... and relax your jaw.

[1:45] Notice your shoulders. If they're holding any tension, imagine it melting away with your next exhale. Let your shoulders drop and soften.

[2:05] Bring awareness to your chest and belly. Feel the gentle movement of your breath. With each exhale, allow yourself to sink deeper into relaxation.

[PAUSE 10 seconds]

[2:25] Notice your arms and hands. Let them feel heavy and relaxed. Release any gripping or holding.

[2:40] Bring attention to your legs. Feel the weight of them. Notice your feet resting. Allow your whole lower body to relax completely.

[3:00] Now expand your awareness to include your entire body. Sense yourself as a whole, breathing naturally, at ease.

[PAUSE 15 seconds]

[3:25] As you rest here, silently repeat to yourself: "I am calm... I am relaxed... I am at peace."

[PAUSE 20 seconds]

[4:00] Notice how your body feels now. Observe any changes in your state of relaxation.

[4:15] Take a slightly deeper breath in... and exhale slowly.

[4:25] In your own time, begin to bring gentle movement back to your fingers and toes.

[4:35] When you're ready, slowly open your eyes, carrying this sense of calm with you.

[4:50] Thank you for taking this time for yourself.

[5:00] END
