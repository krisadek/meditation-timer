MINDFULNESS MEDITATION - 10 MINUTES
Evidence-Based Techniques: Present Moment Awareness + Open Monitoring + Non-Judgmental Observation

[0:00] Welcome to this mindfulness meditation. Find a comfortable seated position with an upright, dignified posture.

[0:20] Allow your eyes to close gently.

[0:30] Take a moment to arrive here, in this present moment. Notice that you've chosen to pause, to practice awareness.

[0:50] Take a deep breath in... and exhale slowly.

[1:00] Again, breathe in... and release.

[1:10] One more time... inhale... and let it go.

[1:20] Allow your breathing to return to its natural state.

[1:30] Mindfulness is simply paying attention to what's happening right now, without trying to change it or judge it.

[1:50] Begin by noticing your breath. Not controlling it, just observing. Where do you feel it? The nose? The chest? The belly?

[2:10] Rest your attention gently on the sensation of breathing.

[PAUSE 20 seconds]

[2:40] Now expand your awareness to include physical sensations in your body. What do you notice?

[2:55] Perhaps you feel the pressure where your body meets the chair or floor.

[3:10] Maybe you notice temperature... warmth or coolness on your skin.

[3:25] Perhaps there's tingling, tension, ease, or heaviness somewhere.

[3:40] Simply notice whatever sensations are present. You're not trying to feel anything special, just aware of what's here.

[PAUSE 20 seconds]

[4:10] Notice sounds. Near or far. Loud or soft. Pleasant or unpleasant. Without labeling or judging, just hearing.

[4:35] Sounds arise... exist for a moment... and pass away. Just like everything else.

[PAUSE 20 seconds]

[5:05] Notice thoughts. They come and go like clouds passing through the sky. You don't need to push them away or follow them. Just notice: "A thought is here."

[5:30] You are not your thoughts. You are the awareness that notices thoughts.

[5:45] Observe them with friendly curiosity, then gently return to breath awareness.

[PAUSE 30 seconds]

[6:25] You might notice emotions present. Perhaps calm, boredom, frustration, peace, restlessness. Whatever is here is okay.

[6:45] Name it silently: "Calm is here" or "Restlessness is here." Then let it be, without needing to change it.

[7:05] This is mindfulness: being with what is, as it is, in this moment.

[PAUSE 30 seconds]

[7:45] Return your attention to your breath, your anchor in the present moment.

[8:00] Breathing in, aware of breathing in. Breathing out, aware of breathing out.

[8:20] Each breath happens only once. This breath, right now, has never happened before and will never happen again.

[8:40] Be here for it. Fully present. Fully aware.

[PAUSE 40 seconds]

[9:30] Take a slightly deeper breath in... and exhale slowly.

[9:40] Notice how you feel right now. More present? More aware? Simply observe.

[9:50] This quality of awareness is always available to you. You can return to the present moment simply by noticing your breath.

[10:05] Gently open your eyes when you're ready.

[10:15] Carry this mindful presence with you.

[10:00] END
